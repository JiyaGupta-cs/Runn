# Zombie Simulation Game

Welcome to the **Zombie Simulation Game**! In this game, you'll be programming zombies to roam around, biting each other and converting them into their type of zombie. The goal is to observe how different types of zombies behave and interact in the simulated environment.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the `bext` module installed before running the game. If not, you can install it by following the instructions at [Bext on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Bext/).

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing the provided Python script.
2. Watch as zombies move, bite each other, and transform into new zombies.
3. Observe the simulation to see how different types of zombies behave and interact.
4. The simulation will continue until you interrupt it with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+C).

## Zombie Types
- **Turning Zombie (green):** Turns to the right at each step.
- **Still Zombie (yellow):** Stays still and bites any zombie in front of it.
- **Wandering Zombie (blue):** Randomly turns left, right, or moves forward.

## Controls
- Press Enter to start the simulation.

## Note
- The simulation may take some time to showcase interesting interactions among zombies.
- You can interrupt the simulation at any time using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C.

Have fun programming your zombies and exploring the world of zombie interactions! üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
