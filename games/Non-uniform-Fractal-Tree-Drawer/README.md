# Turtle Tree Drawing

## Description

Turtle Tree Drawing is a Python program that utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create mesmerizing, randomly generated tree structures. Each tree is unique, thanks to the pseudorandom parameters determining the tree's appearance. Watch as the trees evolve and change with every iteration.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `main.py`).
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter (`python main.py`).
4. Observe the artistic rendering of trees on the Turtle graphics window.

## Artistic Trees

The program generates artistic trees with varying branch angles, lengths, and thickness. Each tree's appearance is influenced by pseudorandom parameters, providing a visually pleasing and unpredictable experience.

## Seed Variation

Experiment with different seed values to observe how the trees' characteristics change. The seed affects the randomness of the tree generation, providing endless possibilities for unique tree designs.

## Note

Customize the artistic trees by modifying parameters such as LEFT_ANGLE, RIGHT_ANGLE, LEFT_DECREASE, RIGHT_DECREASE, and START_SIZE. Explore the beauty of generative art and enjoy the evolving patterns created by Turtle Tree Drawing!
