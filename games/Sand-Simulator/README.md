# Sand Simulation

## Description

Sand Simulation is a Python console-based program that simulates the movement of sand particles falling from sources and piling up on the ground. The simulation uses simple rules to depict the behavior of sand particles as they fall and stack on top of each other.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `main.py`).
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter (`python main.py`).

## Simulation Features

- Sand particles fall from specified sources.
- Sand particles move horizontally if there is no space to fall vertically.
- The simulation continues until manually interrupted (e.g., press `Ctrl-C` to stop).

## Constants

- `WIDTH`: Width of the simulation area (default is 80).
- `HEIGHT`: Height of the simulation area (default is 25).
- `PAUSE_LENGTH`: Pause time between simulation steps (default is 0.2 seconds).
- `SAND`: ASCII character representing sand (default is 'â–‘').

## Sources

Multiple sources are placed in the simulation area, each generating sand particles at a specific frequency.

## Author

Sand Simulation is created by [Author's Name].

## Note

This simulation is a simple representation of sand movement and is meant for educational and visual purposes. Feel free to experiment with the code and explore different behaviors of sand particles!

**Enjoy the Simulation!**
